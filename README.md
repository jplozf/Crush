# Crush | *A friendly program interface for those who don't have one*
## Summary
- **Crush** aims to provide a graphical interface to command line programs which by definition do not have one. Typically, Crush will build a dynamic graphical interface made up of input fields, checkboxes or drop-down lists from a previously defined XML file specifying all the options of the program to be launched. This eliminates the need to remember all the options and their syntax.
